# Stylesheet

Rules:

* Use camelCase for every variable name and start every variable name with a letter.
* Always put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ), and after commas.
* Always use 2 spaces for indentation of code blocks.
* General rules for complex (compound) statements:

  * Put the opening bracket at the end of the first line.
  * Use one space before the opening bracket.
  * Put the closing bracket on a new line, without leading spaces.
  * Do not end a complex statement with a semicolon.

  If a statement is very simple the statement is on one line between the brackets.
* Line length < 80 characters.
* Comments should start with a capital letter, but a dot at the end is not necessary.
* Always use the same amount of quotation marks for strings.
* Each method should be on its own indented line.
* If possible, a variable should have a self-explanatory name. If not, variables should have logical names.
* More complex functions should have a name and should be placed just before the closing bracket.
