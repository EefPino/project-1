## day 1 (9/1/2019)

Today I started making my shaded world map with the Nobel prize data. I soon realised that a lot of the country
names in the Nobel prize dataset didn't accord with country names in the world map dataset, because of
changes in names over the years (1900 till now).
So I had to manually change many of these names.

Another problem is the fact that the Nobel prize dataset has a column for which country the winner(s) "belong to",
but in many cases this column has the value 'null'.
Which is why I decided to see the country of birth as the country the Nobel prize belongs to.

Progress: my world map is now shaded and my dataset is complete and correct.
