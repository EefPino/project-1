# Proposal

Name: Tula Kaptein
Student Number: 11013478

## Problem Statement:
### Problem:
Iran has a beautiful and rich history, which makes it a very interesting country
for travelling purposes. Unfortunately, it is not perceived this way because of
the strict religious rules that were implemented when Iran became an Islamic
Republic.

### Target audience:
People with an interest in the Middle East.

## Solution:
### Idea:
To show different statistics about Iran to give the user a more correct view of
Iran.

### Visual sketch:
The visual sketch can be found in the doc folder.
### Main features:
#### 1: Minimum viable product
+ Add different filters to the data presented
+ Show line/barcharts
+ When datapoints are hovered, show the datavalue.

#### 2: Optional implementations
+ Compare data from Iran to data from Turkey
+ Make an interactive map of Iran that shows touristic attractions per city/province.

### External components:
Not clear yet.

### Review of similar related visualizations:
This is a website that visualizes conflict situations in Middle-Eastern countries, such as Iran, with an interactive map, information, a line chart and a bar chart.
https://www.acleddata.com/dashboard/#364
I think this is a clear way to visualize the data, but I would like to make it more selective. The user should choose which data he/she wants visualized and that will determine the kind of chart that 'appears', instead of a page full of data visualisations.

### Hardest parts:
