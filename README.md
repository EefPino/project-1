# Proposal

Name: Tula Kaptein  
Student Number: 11013478

## Problem Statement:
### Problem:
Iran has a beautiful and rich history, which makes it a very interesting country
for travelling purposes. Unfortunately, it is not perceived this way because of
the strict religious rules that were implemented when Iran became an Islamic
Republic.

### Target audience:
People with an interest in the Middle East.

## Solution:
### Idea:
To show different statistics about Iran to give the user a more correct view of
Iran.

### Visual sketch:
![](doc/visualSketch.png)
* Left, upper: a sketch of the sites pages and interactions.
* Right, upper: an example of one of the graphs that would be on the Dashboard. Features of this graph would be:
  * Showing information about the conflict/point of interest when hovering over a dot.
  * Selecting which kinds of conflict are shown on the map
* Left, down: an example of a bar graph. I would use such a graph to visualise the economic and social indicators. Features of this graph would be:
  * Selecting the year you want visualised

I'd also like to include line graphs, that, for example, interact with
a bar graph, adding different dimensions to one dataset.

### Main features:
#### 1: Minimum viable product
+ Add different filters to the data presented
+ Show line/bar charts
+ When data points are hovered, show the data value.

#### 2: Optional implementations
+ Compare data from Iran to data from Turkey
+ Make an interactive map of Iran that shows touristic attractions per city/province.

### External components:
Not clear yet.

### Review of similar related visualisations:
[This](https://www.acleddata.com/dashboard/#364) is a website that visualises conflict situations in Middle-Eastern countries, such as Iran, with an interactive map, information, a line chart and a bar chart.

I think this is a clear way to visualise the data, but I would like to make it more selective.
The user should choose which data he/she wants visualised and that will
determine the kind of chart that 'appears', instead of a page full of data visualisations.

### Hardest parts:
Not clear yet.
