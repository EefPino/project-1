# Proposal

Name: Tula Kaptein
Student Number: 11013478

## Problem Statement:
### Problem:
Iran is perceived as a third world country, because of the strict religious rules it got when it became an Islamic Republic. However, if you look at social, economical or 'health' data this isn't correct.
### Target audience:
Western people with an interest in the Middle East.

## Solution:
### Idea:
To show different statistics about Iran to give the user a more correct view of Iran over the last 5 years.
### Visual sketch:
The visual sketch can be found in the doc folder.
### Main features:
#### 1: Minimum viable product
+ Add different filters to the data presented
+ Show line/barcharts
+ When datapoints are hovered, show the datavalue.

#### 2: Parts that are optional to implement
+ Compare data from Iran to data from Turkey
+ Make an interactive map of Iran that shows touristic attractions per city/province.

## Prerequisites:
### Data sources:
* Dataset that shows conflict situations in Iran:
https://www.acleddata.com/data/
* Datasets of economic and social indicators in Iran:
https://data.world/hdx/e2596787-a8e5-4b29-8527-57e77817c4ce/workspace/file?filename=population-total-11.json
* Datasets of economic and social indicators in Turkey:

### External components:
Not clear yet.

### Review of similar related visualizations:
This is a website that visualizes conflict situations in Middle-Eastern countries, such as Iran, with an interactive map, information, a line chart and a bar chart.

I think this is a clear way to visualize the data, but I would like to make it more selective. The user should choose which data he/she wants visualized and that will determine the kind of chart that 'appears', instead of a page full of data visualisations.

### Hardest parts:
Not clear yet.
